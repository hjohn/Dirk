This module contains copied and modified sources from org.apache.commons:commons-lang3:3.12.0
under the conditions specified in the Apache License, Version 2.0 (https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

The sources were modified to eliminate any code not strictly required to use the TypeUtils
class for supporting generic types and type variables.

This reduces the footprint of including this library to the bare minimum required for
this project.
